    <h1>The Global Toll of Tobacco</h1>
    <h2>Smoking</h2>
    <p>Tobacco smoking is one of the world's largest health problems. Millions of people
        <br>live in poor health because of it. Researchers estimate that every year around <a
         style="text-decoration: underline; color: #FF0000;">8<br>
          million people</a> die an early death due to smoking.
        <br>
        <br>It has been a major health problem for many decades. For the entire 20th century,
        <br>it is estimated that around <a
         style="text-decoration: underline; color: #FF0000;">100 million people</a> died prematurely because of smoking,
        <br>most of them in rich countries.
        <br>
        <br>The share of smokers among the world population is falling, and because smoking is
        <br>such a large health problem today, this is one of the most positive developments in
        <br>global health. It makes it possible for millions of people to live a longer and healthier
        <br>life.
